# Telcome-churn-prediction
## Problem Statement
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business
goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, you will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn.

In this competition, your goal is to build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided for their usage.


# Definitions of churn
. There are various ways to define churn, such as:

# Objective
To Predict the customers who are about to churn from a telecom operator
Business Objective is to predict the High Value Customers only
We need to predict Churn on the basis of Action Period (Churn period data needs to be deleted after labelling)
Churn would be based on Usage
Requirement:
1) Churn Prediction Model
2) Best Predictor Variables

# Approach
1) Data Understanding & Cleaning
2) EDA
3) Derived Metrics
4) Dimensionality Reduction using PCA
5) Classification models to predict Churn (Use various Models & Handle class imbalance)
6) Model Evaluation
7) Prepare Model for Predictor variables selection (Prepare multiple models & choose the best one)
8) Summarize
